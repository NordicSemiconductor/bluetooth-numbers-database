# Rules and Contributions

* The purpose of this project is to be an online shared directory of Bluetooth numbers, so all listings (Company IDs, Services, etc.) **can and are meant to** be extended by the community, as long as they're Bluetooth SIG-Compliant. (More on this below.)
* Only new 128-bit Company IDs can be freely contributed, since [all 16-bit identifiers are assigned by Bluetooth SIG itself](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/16-bit-uuids-for-members/). Exceptions will be handled on a case-to-case basis, but only under very special circumstances.
* Many 16-bit UUIDs assigned to Bluetooth SIG Members are currently missing, because the official listing does not provide enough information. We are hoping the owners of said UUIDs could either provide us with the information we need (Description and Identifier), or submit a pull request themselves.
* No duplicate 128-bit UUIDs or identifiers within each GATT Attribute Category (Services, Characteristics and Descriptors) are allowed. If a conflict exists, it'll be managed on a case-to-case basis.

Furthermore, please feel free to raise issues or pull requests with your own suggestions about how this project can or should improve. **We at Nordic do not view Bluetooth Numbers Database as our property**, but as a shared endeavour with the rest of the developer and Bluetooth communities.
